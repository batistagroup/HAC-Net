In order to create a function to perform the entire HAC-Net prediction pipeline that is user-friendly and does not require any external programs, we introduce a few subtle discrepancies related to preprocessing the input files, although the original function is still available in HACNet/functions.py

Discrepancies:
- Rather than using protein pocket PDB files provided by PDBbind, we create the pockets from the original protein PDB file, attempting to mimic their protocol
- Rather than using Chimera to add hydrogens to the pocket PDB file and convert to Mol2 format, we use PyMOL
- We select the eqeq charge calculation method for all predictions (this method was used for > 99.9 % of complexes presented in our journal article)

Testing HACNet with this data-preprocessing protocol on the PDBbind 2016 core set protein-ligand complexes yields the following results:
- Pearson r: 0.83
- Spearman p: 0.82
- RMSE: 1.26
- MAE: 1.01

Quantitative comparison between predict_hdf (original) and predict_pkd methods on the PDBbind 2016 core set:
- Pearson r: 0.98
- Spearman p: 0.98
- RMSE: 0.35
- MAE: 0.23
